# goals

frontend

- scanner (lexical analysis)
- parser (syntax analysis with ast generation)
- error reporter (error handling and basic semantic checks)

backend

- ir/bytecode generator (code generation)
- optimizer (constant folding, dead code elimination, etc.)
- virtual machine (bytecode execution engine)

features

- modular compiler architecture
- implementation of a simple procedural language
